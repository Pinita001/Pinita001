# 👋 Hi, I'm **Pinita Thavamani**

### Engineer • Systems Thinker • Product & Strategy Focused

Final-year Electrical & Electronic Engineering student at NTU  
(Specialising in Computing & Intelligent Systems)

I focus on turning messy workflows into structured, scalable systems.  
My work sits at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and business impact.

Rather than just writing code, I care about:
- Translating stakeholder needs into technical solutions  
- Structuring ambiguous problems into clear execution paths  
- Connecting data insights to decision-making  
- Building systems that improve operational outcomes  

---

## 🧠 Core Strengths

- 📊 Analytics & ETL pipelines (Python, SQL)
- 🔌 API design & backend systems
- 🧩 Requirements gathering & workflow optimisation
- 📈 Dashboarding & insight communication
- 🤝 Bridging technical teams & business stakeholders

---

## 🚀 Selected Work Themes

- Translated B2B rental workflows into backend systems (Java Spring Boot)
- Built analytics dashboards improving referral turnaround by 30%
- Developed ETL pipelines to uncover revenue concentration patterns
- Designed REST APIs and stakeholder-facing dashboards

---

## 🎯 Career Direction

I am building toward Product, Consulting, and Transformation roles where I can:

- Influence direction, not just execution  
- Align technology with business strategy  
- Lead cross-functional initiatives  
- Scale systems, teams, and impact
